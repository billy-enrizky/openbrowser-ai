# TODO File Location

The project TODO file is located at `local_docs/todo.md`, NOT at `docs/todo.md` or the repository root.

## Rules

- ALWAYS write session summaries and TODOs to `local_docs/todo.md`
- NEVER write todo.md to `docs/` (reserved for public framework documentation)
- NEVER commit or push `local_docs/todo.md` (it is gitignored)
